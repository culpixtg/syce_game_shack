T\xF6ws and we all started playing it as a group. It was a blast to play something more difficult than Wordle, but we still found it uncommon to fail to guess both words in 7 attempts.

In a moment of evil and genius, <a href='https://github.com/DavidMah' target='_blank' style='text-decoration-line:underline;'>David Mah</a> hacked together the first prototype of Quordle on January 30th and linked it to the group chat. It was truly horrific code (it even had 2 keyboards \u{1F605}), but I knew that I had to continue the madness. With hindsight, he really baited me into finishing his monstrous creation.

Over the next 2 days I improved the code, removed the second keyboard, and added the color quadrant keyboard. I even added Google Analytics thinking it would be funny to see the stats for our friend group playing.

At first it was just a few dozen players (there was a group of 20-30 people in Ohio that were playing constantly the first few days). But then Quordle got written about in an article in <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/06/worried-about-losing-wordle-here-are-some-alternatives-just-in-case' target='_blank' style='text-decoration-line:underline;'>The Guardian</a> and things exploded quickly from there. Now Quordle has over 2 million players daily and has had over 15 million total players.

A shoutout to our friend that plays relentlessly while indoor cycling. You were the drive to create a better version and your passion made me realize it could be popular outside of our friend group. I am so glad the world has been thoroughly cursed by Quordle and can't wait to see how Quordle strategies evolve!

I have no plans to monetize Quordle, I just enjoy watching everyone enjoy this insane game and couldn't have done it without Guilherme S. T\xF6ws and David Mah.
